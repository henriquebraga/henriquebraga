⚡ Fun facts about me: 

* I love to teach, learn and talk about different stuff.
* I love working out. I think it was a game changer for my mindset and how to handle life issues. 
* Sometimes I write technical stuff on my Medium blog. I usually write in pt-br language because  there's already such good materials in english, so I strongly believe that writing in portuguese might help more people in Brazil, since most of people are not fluent in english, unfortunately 😞.
* Blue is my favorite color 🟦
* I love japanese food 🍣
